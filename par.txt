We developed an automated process for baseline correction
based on the noise median method (NMM) by Friedrichs (1995),
which was developed for use with nuclear magnetic resonance
data. As such, the method had to be adapted slightly to be
useful for Raman spectrum data. The original NMM estimates
the baseline at each sampled point by finding the median value
of the local minima and maxima within a window of some width W
around the sampled point, and then convolving the median values
with a normalized Gaussian of some width $\sigma$. This method works
well if the number of real extrema is negligible compared to the number
of extrema that are a product of noise, which is not a good assumption
for our dataset. We therefore introduced another parameter, P,
that is the percentile of extrema taken into consideration when
taking the median. For instance, for $P=80$, only extrema smaller
than the 80th percentile extremum count towards the median. This
works best in areas where the signal dominates over noise, with
real maxima forming about (100-P)% of the total number of extrema
within the window. For areas where noise dominates, it biases
the estimated baseline slightly downward. Regarding the points
at the spectrum boundaries, the original NMM covers two cases -
one where the noise level at one end is about equal to the noise
level at the other end (which does not apply in our dataset),
and another where the median values for the boundary points
(the points within W/2 of the spectrum boundaries) are set equal
to the value calculated for the point W/2 (or N-W/2, where N is
the total number of points), thereby estimating the baselines as
constant for the first and last W/2 points. This is a good
estimate for data in which W << N, but that is not the case
for the values of W that proved optimal in our dataset. We instead
chose to estimate the baseline around these boundary points such that
the value at point number A < W/2 is calculated from the window
between points number 1 and A+W/2, and analogously for points at the
higher bound.
